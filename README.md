Tools and Technologies used

  * React, Redux
  * Lodash for data manipulation
  * Webpack for bundling
  * Highcharts for data visualisations
  
Features in Progress

  * Ground Analysis for matches won and lost on each cricket stadium 
  * Adding a type ahead drop down for selecting players and cricket stadiums since it is hard to pick from a long dropdown
  * Offline access to the application
  * Filter the heat map based on a team to show the runs made by a team in each and every match
  * Move only the facts on the carousal and not the image 
  * Add appropriate messages when a certain player has not been part of a season and hence no data to show
  
Technical Debt

  * Move javascript logic from jsx files
  * Optimize data load instead of loading all the data on the dashboard page
  * Move data to firebase or AWS
